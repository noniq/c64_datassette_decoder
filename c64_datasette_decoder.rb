# This script is a proof of concept for decoding data recorded on cassette tapes
# with / for a Commodore 64 (using the default “Kernal” routines). It reads
# audio data from a file named `sampledata.wav` and prints a hexdump of the
# decoded bytes to stdout.
#
# More info about the data encoding used on these tapes can be found here:
# http://c64tapes.org/dokuwiki/doku.php?id=loaders:rom_loader

# First step: Create a data stream of raw audio sample data. Note that we read
